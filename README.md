# Surfs-Up! Oahu Temperature Trend Analysis

CWRU Data Analytics Module Nine Challenge


## Overview of Project

The project involved learning about using SQLAlchemy and Flask to query a dataset containing weather station observations in Oahu, Hawaii and reflect statistics on a web page.  The effort included using data frames and capabilities such as sorting and a variety of statistical summaries around the frequency of measurements, precipitation and temperature.    


### Purpose

The purpose of the Challenge was to determine if a proposed surfing and ice cream business would be sustainable year-round   

## Analysis 

The Challenge focused upon temperature analysis for June and December.  This involed filtering the query from the data for all the June and December measurements and producing statistics for comparision and assessment of trend during the year.  The query results were converted into a list and loaded into a dataframe where statistics were generated 


### Summary

The analysis shows only slight changes in temperature in Oahu between June and December.  It is a little cooler in December than June and the temperatures vary a bit more in December - in particular it looks like there are a few days about 9 degrees cooler than in June.  Nonetheless, it seems like a surf and ice cream shop will do well by the weather !
